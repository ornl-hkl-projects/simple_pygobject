Attempt at creating a simple use of PyGObject to a custom package (not, for instance, gtk). This is for basic understanding of the python bindings used in hkl.

PyGObjects are bindings for GNOME apps such as gtk. I believe all gnome apps are related to their gui's. It might be simpler to compile --disable-gui within EPICS initially

assuming conda env for now

conda env create -n simple_pygobject python=3.8
conda activate simple_pygobject
conda install -c conda-forge pygobject
